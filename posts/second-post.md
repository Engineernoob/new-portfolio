# Why I Took the Job

First, I had no choice — my mom straight-up gave me a deadline of December 1st to get a job and start paying her $200 a month.
So I did what every stressed-out college student does: panic internally, then immediately hit “Apply Now” on anything that didn’t involve flipping burgers or being yelled at by customers for ice cream machines being down.

That’s how I ended up at UPS orientation today.

# 🎒 Orientation Day: The Real “Welcome to Peak Season”

Walking into the orientation was entering a weird crossover of the Amazing Race and LinkedIn. You've got:

- high school kids trying to make holiday money
- grown adults who took on this job to keep their head above the rising rent and housing prices
- Then College Students (me) who are just trying to survive.

The Coordinator explained the role to us in the room :
| “You don’t drive the truck. You ride along. You jump out. You deliver the package. You jump back in. Repeat until your soul leaves your body.”

Okay -- that's not what she exactly said, but it was the vibe.

They made it clear :
This job is physical, fast, and flexible - shifts comes in based on needs. When they assign you, they give you a **meet point**, usually near your home, where the driver comes to pick you up.

And that's when it hit's me:

This isn't the "holiday helper" gig you see in the commericals.

This is **cardio** disguised as employment.

# Why This Job Makes Sense (Even as a CS Student)

Let me keep it real :
This job has nothing to do with CS...._directly_.
But indirectly? It connects to the state of the 2025 job market more than people realize.

Because here’s the truth nobody sugar-coats anymore:

The 2025 CS job market is brutal.

Not “kinda tough.”
Brutal.

You’ve got:

job postings asking for 3 years of AI experience for an internship

entry-level roles requiring “production-level LLM deployment experience”

startups ghosting candidates like they’re on dating apps

big tech hiring freezes disguised as “strategic efficiency realignments”

every student applying to the same 12 companies

So yeah, if you’re a CS student in 2025, you’re probably doing multiple things at once:

studying

building projects

applying to jobs

surviving financially

trying not to lose your mind

This UPS job?

It’s not a CS role — but it is a lifeline.

It buys me stability, structure, and deadlines.
It gives me space to keep working on my projects — Ratio, Cortex, etc — without worrying about how I’m paying for food or WiFi.

Sometimes the smartest thing you can do for your future is just securing your present.

# The Bigger Picture: What This Shows About Work in 2025

Taking a non-tech job doesn’t make you “less” of an engineer.
It makes you realistic.
Adaptable.
Grounded.

And honestly? Logistics is one of the industries

where AI + humans interact the most:

route optimization

predictive delivery

computer vision sorting

digital scanners

real-time tracking

automated dispatch systems

So while I'm jumping in and out of a brown truck, I’m literally watching algorithmic systems run in the real world.

This isn’t just a job.

It’s a reminder of what good engineering actually supports:

People. Movement. Time. Reality.

# 🌱 My Mindset Going Forward

I’m not embarrassed about taking this role — I’m proud of it.
Because it shows:

I’m not waiting for the “perfect tech job” to fall from the sky.

I’m building my future while handling my present.

I’m learning discipline, momentum, and resilience — skills no degree teaches.

This is my life right now.
And honestly? I’m making it work

🔚 Final Thoughts

I start delivering soon.
I’m nervous.
I’m ready.
And I’m doing what I have to do — not just to survive, but to keep moving toward what I’m actually building.

This is the reality of being a CS student in 2025:
You juggle, you hustle, and you keep going.

Even if that means running packages up driveways in the snow.
