# Local-First AI: Building a Desktop LLM Assistant

This is the content of the first blog post. Using local-first technologies like Tauri and Rust allows for unparalleled privacy and speed when working with large language models. This approach ensures your data stays on your device and provides a superior user experience with minimal latency.

## Why Local?

1.  **Privacy:** Your data never leaves your machine.
2.  **Speed:** Latency is reduced to near-zero.
3.  **Cost:** No API costs or subscription fees.
